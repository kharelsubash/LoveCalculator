            "Two personalities governed by the planet Mars are " +
                    "liable to lock horns frequently in combat. Each " +
                    "clearly stakes out a personal territory, a turf where" +
                    " the Aries individuality is asserted, and it requires" +

                    "which acts to channel the awesome energy of each and unites" +
                    " their strengths instead of opposing them. Together, they can " +
                    "generate megawatts! The love which binds them is impulsive," +
                    " fiery, and impatient.",

            //Taurus
            "Both are highly sensual, but Aries may be annoyed by the deliberate pace and unimaginative lovemaking of Taurus. Aries is a fun seeking person and will be trying to entertain him/herself constantly. The thrift of Taurus, who seldom makes anything spontaneously, will irritate. Taurus is good at making money but Aries is even better at spending it. The long haul can be hard going, though if they hang on long enough Aries will come to appreciate Taurus's steadiness and dependability. If Taurus allows Aries to take a lead role, they will find out the new opportunities of sensual pleasure. Otherwise it will be difficult to get a desirable balance. The relationships are usually short term.",

            //Gemini
            "A promise of great excitement and entertainment! Both signs are endowed with good cheer and optimism, which makes them perfect pals. Life together is like an ongoing party, highlighted by flashes of imagination and friendship with others. Gemini easily adapts to the demanding Aries character, while Aries finds his or her partner to be an inexhaustible source of fresh air. The couple lives for the moment, with scarcely a care for tomorrow, but this continual improvisation is not the stuff of which lasting ties are made. Stay tuned for more adventures...",

            //Cancer
            "This combination is usually hard to match. The powerful sexual attraction is a usual thing for these two signs. A problem is that sexual attraction fades in the face of many temperamental differences. Aries leaps without looking; Cancer is cautious. Cancer loves hearth and home; Aries hates being tied down. Resentments build up and they argue over trifles. The discrepancy between their temperaments results in strengthening of incompatibility in bed. Astrological forecast for this couple is a stormy sea, and the marriage for certain will result in ship-wreck.",

            //Leo
            "Both Aries and Leo have aggressive temperaments. Both have got egos to burn and both like to lead. Aggressive Aries wouldn't dream of taking second place, and kingly Leo needs constant admiration. This is particularly true if Aries will allow Leo to hold the center of the floor on occasions. Sharing the limelight is important on Leo's part however, as Aries will feel the need to be on stage once in a while as well. Aries should flatter the Leo on his/her physical fit. Being so much alike sexually can be one of the important things that will keep them true to their commitments. Between the two of them, if one is loving and tactful with the other, meeting that persons emotional needs they can create a steady and long term union. ",

            //Virgo
            "The bravery of the Aries will probably intrigue the imagination of shy, reserved Virgo for a time. However, their sexualities are so different, that they will have to be very patient in order to succeed. Aires's passions are impulsive and direct. Virgo's sexuality is more enigmatic and takes time to be revealed. In other areas Aries is full of exciting new plans and ideas, and insists on being boss. Virgo is critical and fussy, and likes things to be done the way Virgo wants. In case the charts are well aspected for these two it could work, but it will take a lot of effort on both sides. Otherwise the relationships will not be very pleasant and chances for a successful marriage are fifty / fifty. ",

            //Libra
            "There is a powerful initial attraction between these two opposites, for in certain areas each supplies what the other lacks. Both are fond of of sexual pleasures, but the Aries probably will try to go too far too quickly. The Libra is inclined to idealize everything and can lose all illusions. Later Libra will look for someone less demanding, and Aries will bind someone more adoring. The physical connection is possible, but only temporarily. The marriage is very rare. ",

            //Scorpio
            "A bond between these two Mars-ruled signs is ardent, passionate, and often stormy. No neutrality is possible, and day-to-day management of such extreme feelings may prove difficult. Scorpio's possessiveness will not tolerate the slightest unfaithfulness, but the Ram often yields fully to the Scorpion's sensuality - unless he or she is startled into scampering away... This poignant dance, in which each partner vies for control, can be fleeting or long-lasting, sublime or terrifying: there is no happy medium!",

            //Sagittarius
            "The Mars-Jupiter duo are usually an ideal match for each other. Sagittarius is a perfect temperamental match for Aries. They are both active, spontaneous people who like socializing, have extravagant tastes in common, and enjoy the good life. The Aries' optimism and his good sense of humor will help to overcome propensity of the Sagittarius to argue and will bring a funny side into the process of making love. The mutual understanding achieved in a bedroom, can create a favorable atmosphere for the relationships. This is certainly successful and recommended unuion. The marriage will be connected closely with a problem of physical satisfaction. In other words if they make it in the bedroom, they'll make it everywhere else. ",

            //Capricorn
            "Not a hopeful combination. Saturn, represented by Father Time, is the Capricorn's standard bearer. The Aries is a restless,fiery, impulsive experimenter. The Capricorn is on the contrary sanctimonious person. Capricorn needs to dominate and so does Aries. Problems also crop up over money Aries is extravagant, Capricorn is security minded. Capricorn is a simple soul and Aries may be too overwhelming; Aries will take risks and enjoy them while the same risks will make Capricorn shudder. Some very violent quarrels can erupt due to this and the many other personality conflicts. Aries will not like the pessimistic gloom that Capricorn use to dampen the Aries enthusiasms. The Capricorn can prefer only one pose for making love or even the certain time. However, the Aries can take the initiative under his/her own control. If it takes place, a marriage is more preferable then a short connection. ",

            //Aquarius
            "This connection will be stormy and will bring a lot of new emotions. There is a chance that the Aries will be dominating, as the Aquarius is more passive. The planet Uranus, which rules Aquarius, is unpredictable in its actions; therefore, Aquarians have a tendency to procrastinate too much to please the Arien \"up and at ' em\" characteristics. If both sides try a bit of tact & understanding, this great love affair could turn into something special. The Aries must be very tactful if he/she wants to deal with this extremely emotional dreamer. In bedroom Aquarius, while jealous and possessive of his/her partner, rarely overindulges activities as he/she has far more things to do and be engrossed in; therefore he/she is not as sexually active as Aries would like, and Aries will come to see Aquarius as a selfish lover. It is unusual, complete of events connection. In case of marriage a lot will be depending on how much they love each other. ",

            //Pisces
            "Fire and water do not normally mix and that is why the Aries with Pisces love match could be a complex relationship. Aries is self-assured and vivacious; Pisces is somewhat shy and easily led. Aries likes to be dominant, Pisces likes having someone to lean on. The Aries will be intrigued by the behavior of Pisces in the bedroom. The active participation of the Aries will help Pisces get the shyness over. The realization of Pisces' sexual wishes can cause strong excitation. Together they should have interesting and pleasant time. The opportunity of connection or a marriage is very high, if they manage to overcome the differences between their temperaments. ",

            "This isn't the most exciting union ever, for both are domestic creatures who prefer safety to adventure. They are also not always sexually compatible. The woman is more sentimental in love, the man on the contrary is more terrestrial nature. The Taurus- man would rather prefer an other men's company. The Taurus- woman can't bear a deceit or inattention. On the other hand both share a fondness for money, are hardworking, loyal, and affectionate. The perfect solution is for each to develop some outside hobbles and friends without raising the possessive hackles of the other. The connection can and be pleasant, but marriage is under the question. ",

            //Gemini
            "An unpromising match, though at the beginning Taurus responds to Gemini's sparkle and Gemini is intrigued by Taurus's uncomplicated directness. The Gemini's representatives are usually double-faced ,changeable people. The Taurus' representatives are tend to a constancy. Taurus is attracted by an artistry and riches of imagination of the Gemini. However The Gemini are irritated by the Taurus' slow reaction. Taurus with the innate need to possess will never be able to hang on to the unsettled Gemini. Gemini loves change and Taurus resists it. Their sex life is gradually affected by the Gemini moods which are very changeable. Gemini behaves as the playful, mischievous little kid one minute and the next minute he/she will turn basic and animalistic in his/her sexual appetites. The typical Taurus reaction to this action will probably drive him/her into someone elses bed. This is a tasteless connection and there are not the best prospect for a marriage.",

            //cancer
            "Usually this makes a good combination. Both need security and a sense of permanence, and both are loving, affectionate, and passionate as well. The Cancer adds to this union more sensuality and imagination. Both are passionate and do not need any extraneous help to be pleased with each other. The Taurus is capable to understand changes in the mood of the Cancer, and can help smooth the problems if any appears. The Taurus is usually an attentive person. The Cancer is responsive. This relationship can and will improve with age and hard work, as these are such different personalities, and in many ways ones strength supports the others weakness. Cancers sex life is affected by the way they are getting along in the evening and if there is arguing or other unpleasantness Cancer will not make love to Taurus and too much of this could build a wall between them. The understanding of each other problems will help the existence of pleasant connection. A successful marriage is possible if case these two are willing to give rather than get." ,

            //Leo
            "Both are fixed signs, so neither will give an inch. Leo merely becomes angrier and Taurus more obstinate. Leo considers that it is natural for him/her to be a leader in the bedroom. Taurus will supply the attention that Leo requires but will expect it to be returned. Leo loves to dominate and eventually Taurus being strong willed but more patient, will raise the sword when their needs are not being met. Thrifty Taurus is also appalled at Leo's careless spending habits. Taurus is cautious and deliberate; Leo expansive and extravagant. Taurus stubbornly refuses to give Leo constant worship, and Leo is too self-centered to give Taurus the devotion it needs. On the other hand excellent physical qualities and great sex appeal are there for both partners in this match. There is a strong physical and emotional attraction but too many obstacles to hurdle.",

            //Virgo
            "There will be love at first sight- Both are homebodies and they share the same intellectual pursuits. Virgo, while making love prefers simple ways/positions. The Taurus is not against simplicity, but his/her style in sex can be disturbing for Virgo. But in the other aspects of life they don't have many problems. Taurus's tenacity and Virgo's sharp mind are a good combination for success as a team. And Taurus keeps a careful eye on expenditures, which pleases thrifty Virgo. A good connection is possible, but it demands to be more patient from the representatives of the both signs." ,

            //Libra
            "The fact that both signs are influenced by amorous Venus gives their relationship a romantic and sensual outlook. But the sociable Libran's appetite for entertainment and conversation may be stifled by the Bull's stolid contentment with home and hearth. If the charm is broken, the Libra will soar alone. Moreover, Taurean inarticulateness may repel loquacious Libra. Yet with a little flexibility and subtlety, if these two partners want their relationship to last, it can!",

            //Scorpio
            "There's a lot of attraction in this match between two naturally reserved, determined, and physically oriented signs, and great potential for domestic success. Both value financial prosperity and hard work. But if they don't make beautiful music together immediately, a terrible uproar is imminent. Intuitive, emotional Scorpio accumulates negative feelings until they reach critical mass. If Taurus is not ready to handle a meltdown, Scorpio's tenacity will be unbearable and even the Bull will give up. It's either heaven or hell: nothing in between.",

            //sagittarius
            "They are two very different personality types. Extremely sexual Taurus will be pleased with the Sagittarius, but also angry with his/her aspiration to search for love wherever it is only possible. When Taurus refuses to join in with the Sagittarians sporting ways, he/she will find someone who will. There are few, if any natural domestic talents in Sagittarius (unless the stars are well placed) and the Taurus domestic abilities are not given a second thought. Sagittarius hardly notices the Taurus' ability to keep or provide a comfortable home for him/her. They may feel happy together, but there is a short future for this pair. ",

            //capricorn
            "Both partners having mutual understanding of each other's personalities. Both the Capricorn and the Taurus like money, and sure that the safety is really important. While the Taurus is a patient person the Capricorn is ready to work for both of them. Taurus can get through to aloof, cautious Capricorn and give the encouragement and responsiveness needed. Both have earthy, passionate natures, and sensual Taurus can tap the deep well of romanticism that lies under Capricorn's reserve. This couple can conceive everything in the field of sex - every idea will come truth. Capricorn's sexual appetite can be either over indulgent, or he/she may abstain altogether if affected by outside pressures. Taurus will need to be sensitive to Capricorns tension and be willing to discus it and ease his burden of guilt he/she may feel because of it. There are perfect prospects for that couple and it can turn out to be a very compatible marriage. " ,

            //aquarius
            "Aquarius's careless attitude toward love will baffle and finally enrage highly passionate Taurus, who doesn't want someone just to play with. The Aquarius is inclined to analyze everything and not very interested in getting pleasure from making love. The Aquarius would rather prefer to talk, but the sensual Taurus will not be satisfied with such type of love. Taurus will seem to be too requiring for the Aquarius. These two are stubborn in very different ways: Aquarius refuses to be conventional, while Taurus rigidly adheres to the values of family and security. Aquarius is interested in humane concerns; Taurus is single minded about itself and its possessions. Aquarius puts a low emphasis on sex and places it far down on the list of necessities. This attitude could cause Taurus some major upsets as he/she will not be able to accept the problems of the whole world sharing his/her bed, which could cause Taurus to become over demanding in Aquarius' eyes. ",

            //pisces
            "This usually is a very happy combination. Taurus is a strong, authoritative figure who can provide security and stability for vacillating Pisces. Trying to help Pisces make all of their dreams come true, tactfully and reliably encouraging them, a persevering Taurus can achieve all what he wants from these relationships. Success of their sexual harmony depends on the Taurus. These two can share a great deal of their appreciation for beauty, art, sensuality and just about any of the finer things in life. Pisces is easily clouded by emotion but can be brought to reality by Taurus' down to earth nature. Taurus can be helped to dream by the Pisces personality. There are good prospects for interesting affair as well as for healthy marriage. " ,

            "You won't find a more versatile, charming, or vivacious pair. They are fascinating conversationalists, have tons of friends, and together they'll throw some marvelous parties. Love Making is fun and games. On the other hand while this connection can be very pleasant for both sides, it may lose it's stability very quickly. Because their needs are shared and they have mutual understanding of the likes and dislikes of the other then they will be highly in tune sexually. There will be a mad love between them, and marriage won't become an accident. Such combination is possible and it will be the most interesting couple that you know.  ",

            //cancer
            "Gemini's sparkle immediately intrigues Cancer, but Cancer won't find security with fickle, fly-by-night Gemini. The Cancer's self-confidence will decrease during his dialogue with the changeable Gemini, who are fond of pleasures. The unguided sexual energy of the Gemini will create problems for the Cancer. Cancer is the home loving type and will be content to stay there and lock the rest of the world outside, but Gemini would soon become restless and angry over this as he/she is very sociable and likes to be around other people; having no wish to feel as if they are a prisoner in their own home. Life will quickly become unbearable to Gemini. Cancers are driven by emotion and feelings and generally prefer the constant. Gemini's unstoppable movement will prove unsettling to Cancer. Though it is a very emotional connection, the long term connection is almost impossible here. " ,

            //leo
            "An affectionate pair who really enjoy each other. While Leo loves with his/her heart first, Gemini loves with his/her mind. Gemini seem to be romantic enough for Leo. The Gemini's stability will not be fluctuated by the moody Leo. Leo's self-confidence blinks at Gemini's flirtations with others. Gemini's penchant for ridicule can annoy regal Leo, though, and Leo will probably demand more adoration than Gemini is willing to give. It can be a problem but they have so much fun together that don't tend to pay attention to such small problems. Both Leo and Gemini have strong desire to have a passionate, emotional life. Sexually, Leo loves whole-heartly and Geminis variable desires are a complete mystery to him/her. Leo is quite capable of warm-heartly breaking down any resentments that Gemini may harbor from the daytime thereby easing the tension in the bedroom. It will be an acceptable connection and, surely, safe marriage in the future. " ,

            //virgo
            "Both are Mercury ruled and have a mental approach to life. But similarity ends there; these two are star-crossed from the beginning. Gemini treats Virgo as a boring creature. There are precise representations about sexual behavior in the Virgo's head. The Gemini will show indecision. After attenuation of passion's fire Virgo will start to grumble and criticize Gemini. Gemini will start searching for entertainment with someone else in his/her turn. Passions run on a low thermostat; their sex life soon turns chilly. This is going to be as short as flash relationship, which has not a chance to last long time." ,

            //libra
            "These two air signs are well suited intellectually and every other way. It is difficult for the representatives of both signs to control their passions. If love makes this world spinning around then this couple gives an initial push for it. This is an ideal partnership. Both favor similar changes of interests. In the case of this pair, Libra is the judge and Gemini is the responsive jury in the nuptial courthouse. The combination's intellectual and artistic interests are compatible. Both sides of the Gemini nature will be under stood by the Libra. Both of them are passionate and nobody is too jealous at the same time . They characters have a lot in common , and they perfectly understand each other in bedroom. Libra is highly sexed and their lovemaking will never go lacking. Their sex-life will never be dull. This is a perfect connection; warm and happy married couple. ",

            //scorpio
            "Gemini's imagination and Scorpio's dynamism can make a good combination if only these two are able to get along together. They are close in the sexual relationships, but that is not enough. Gemini is the type who tries to live a full, busy life but not so with Scorpio, as Scorpio is more centered on the idea of self improvement. Scorpio is sensual, passionate, demanding, jealous, inflexible. Gemini is fickle, flighty, superficial, lighthearted, changeable. Gemini is a social creature, Scorpio likes privacy. The representatives of Gemini'sign take everything too easy for the Scorpio. The Scorpio is purposeful while the Gemini are always doubting. It will probably be a kind of relationships that is not easy to cope with with difficult marriage as a result. " ,

            //sagittarius
            "These two are opposites in the zodiac and are attracted to each other like magnets. They are both tireless, changeable and not frank enough as lovers. Gemini are inclined to criticize the Sagittarius' behavior in bed. They may be disappointed sexually, since neither is demonstrative-and Gemini is very quick to criticize. There are also some other weak points in their relationships while the strength is that they are both undemanding people. Their affair will probably begin impulsively and will be finished suddenly as well. The marriage can turn out to be quite good but it will require efforts from both of them." ,

            //capricorn
            "They have different sexual natures. The Saturn ruled Capricorn will be at odds with the Mercury ruled Gemini. The Gemini are usually easy-going, amorous people, while the Capricorn are sluggish, devoted, cautious. Capricorn will have a hard time holding the reins on excitable, flirtatious, wayward Gemini. All of Capricorn's patience is needed to deal with a partner it considers to be capricious, extravagant, and scatterbrained. In order for the sexual relationship to be a success, Gemini will have to distract Capricorns mind from his/her career and the problems that go with it. The initial interest can not last very long." ,

            //aquarius
            "Uranus, the ruling planet of Aquarius, is full of surprises and sudden changes. This will suit the Gemini perfectly. Gemini are capable to subordinate to the Aquarius' will. There will be a lot of pleasant things in a bedroom though the lack of passions is also possible. The changeable Gemini are easily influenced by the Aquarius' constant pressure. They love to socialize, they have a wide range of outside activities, and neither is particularly jealous or proprietary. Sexual attraction with them is likely to be intense, as Aquarius finds Gemini to be very attractive physically. This couple will be fine bed-mates and fascinating friends. It is an interesting connection which may turn into a charming marriage." ,

            //pisces
            "The passion quotient is high, and so are the problems. The Pisces are too emotional for Gemini. Emotional Pisces for his/her turn is too easily hurt by thoughtless Gemini. Gemini is mischievous and playful, but Pisces is sensitive and takes things to heart. It creates an atmosphere of suspiciousness and mistrust. There can be a feeling of flame between them but the instability in their relations will destroy connection as a result. This is a rather risky connection and unhappy marriage. ",

            "They have a lot in common, and that's the trouble. They are too similar to be happy together. Both suffer from excessive sensitivity and that results in emotional problems. Both want to play a main role in the sexual relationships, and it often causes a criticism and disputes. They both take words and actions to be literal truths and that can mean some consistent pain and unrest for them. They tend to see themselves as martyrs, vastly giving individuals, and when one does not see this in the other then the reaction is shock. They will waste a lot of time together, better spent on other things, in the middle of petty bickering and dredging up the past mistakes of the other. However physically they attract each other and this connection can be rather sensual. The marriage demands a great goodwill and mutual understanding. " ,

            //leo
            "Usually this is a good combination, since the Moon (Cancer) reflects the light of the Sun (Leo). The Leo has an ability to stabilize moody Cancer. Generous, openhearted, strong Leo is just what insecure Cancer is looking for and it creates a feeling of reliance for a changeable Cancer. On the other hand it is necessary to flatter and admire by the Leo's advantages and especially in the field of sex, where he/she should dominate. If the Cancer is ready to let the Leo be the leader in bedroom the passionate connection and rather successful marriage can take place." ,

            "Cancer's responses are emotive while Virgo's are analytical, but their personalities mesh so well that it doesn't seem to matter. The Virgo is practical person and gives a basis for this union. The Cancer is more emotional creature but they are capable to feel pleasure from their relationships. They perfectly fit each other in the bedroom. One of the dangers in this relationship will be too much caring! Each one of these signs love to look after, and fuss around the person they love, which will go far in making life intolerable for both of them. Together these signs do a lot of talking about things that need doing; each one needs to be paired with a positive personality for anything but talk to get accomplished. This can turn out to be quite interesing connection in case the Virgo is little less demonstrative and affectionate with cancer." ,

            //libra
            "This pair operates on entirely different levels: Cancer wants love to be emotionally transcendent, Libra seeks perfect intellectual communion. It is difficult for the Libra to get on well with a Cancer's changeable temperament. The Cancer for his turn feels uncertainty and anxiety because of the Libra's attachment. The Libra is attracted by the Cancer's moods, but he/she prefers to avoid any troubles. Cancer will have to bring some excitement and glamour into the bedroom and their love making if he/she would capture and hold Libras attention, as he/she has a roving eye and will always be looking for greener pastures, sex being the important part of life to him/her that it is. But if Cancer turns critical, especially about Libra's extravagance, Libra will start looking elsewhere. The connection is possible. The marriage is almost unreal. " ,

            "Masterful Scorpio should make a good mate for quiet spoken Cancer. The Scorpio's force and his/her needs to dominate and protect is just what the Cancer is longing for. Cancer's possessiveness will actually make Scorpio feel secure. Cancer admires Scorpio's strength while Scorpio finds a haven in Cancer's emotional commitment. The Cancer is more sensitive about sexual relations, while the Scorpio is more passionate. The Cancer's desire to please helps avoid many problems in this area. The the Scorpio's furious jealousy does not arise, since the Cancer is devoted to the partner. The love will be growing, and this passionate connection can develop in a perfect marriage." ,

The Cancer wants to be sure of the love of the partner. The Sagittarius is not capable to ensure it. The Cancer lives for the sake of the future. Sagittarius lives for today. Cancer's jealousy is aroused by Sagittarius's flighty, faithless ways; Sagittarius is bored by Cancer's dependency. Sagittarius likes to wander, while Cancer is a stay-at-home. When Sagittarius feels boredom he/she begins searching for new connections/partners. The Cancer will be deeply offended by this fact. Sexually, Sagittarius is very active, and as a rule Cancer is easily satisfied. This can leave Sagittarius feeling let down and depressed and unfulfilled, which in turn will send him/her searching for a new partner. There are vague prospects of more - less steady connection.",

Both are good money managers and are unlikely to have many financial problems. Waste is an offense to Capricorn as is extravagance. Capricorn is a faithful and devoted mate which the more positive type of Cancer can be content with, even if life does get a little boring at times. However, there are a strong sexual attraction exists between these two signs. In a bedroom everything will be perfect, until Cancer feels bored with a practicality and restraint of the Capricorn. The connection is unstable, the marriage is undesirable.",

Aquarians love to share their life stories with the world while Cancer is satisfied to concentrate on personal obligations. Cancer have a conservative taste; Aquarius taste are usually the opposite. The Cancer's needs can't remain unsatisfied. Aquarius tends to exempt him/herself from the emotional requirements. They are able to find common language in bedroom for some time, though they will not sustain this partnership in a drawing room for a long time. The eccentricity of Uranus does not go well with the moods of Luna. Odds against this combination are too great for this combination, unless one will become subservient to the other.",

Pisces is an imaginative dreamer but Cancer is an imaginative worker-and together they can make their dreams a reality. Pisces provides romance in Cancer's life, and Cancer is the all-protective lover Pisces needs. They are a good pair in the field of sex. They are both sympathetic and try to support each other. Probably the Cancer will be the leader, because of the the Pisces' inclination for some eccentricity in love affairs. The quarrels are usually short and quickly come to an end in bed. They are perfectly fit for each other. They can spend their time during day and during night with the same result and the sentimental combination of these two signs make for an ideal marriage.",

They enjoy a strong sex drive and these two will probably spend a lot of their time together in bed. This could develop into an overactive sex life that may branch off in perverse directions, totally without love, unless checked and kept within bounds.
